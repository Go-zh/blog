* Introduction

Today we released version 1.5.5 the Go App Engine SDK. You can download it from the [[http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html][App Engine downloads page]].

This release includes changes and improvements to the App Engine APIs and brings the supporting Go tool chain to [[https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#r60][release.r60.2]] (the current stable release). Also included in this release are the [[https://golang.org/cmd/godoc/][godoc]], [[https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/][gofmt]], and [[https://golang.org/cmd/gofix/][gofix]] tools from the Go tool chain. They can be found in the root directory of the SDK.

Some changes made in this release are backwards-incompatible, so we have incremented the SDK `api_version` to 3. Existing apps will require code changes when migrating to `api_version` 3.

The gofix tool that ships with the SDK has been customized with App Engine-specific modules. It can be used to automatically update Go apps to work with the latest appengine packages and the updated Go standard library. To update your apps, run:

	    /path/to/sdk/gofix /path/to/your/app

The SDK now includes the appengine package source code, so you can use the local godoc to read App Engine API documentation:

	    /path/to/sdk/godoc appengine/datastore Get

*Important*note:* We have deprecated `api_version` 2. Go apps that use `api_version` 2 will stop working after 16 December 2011. Please update your apps to use api_version 3 before then.

See the [[http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/SdkForGoReleaseNotes][release notes]] for a full list of changes. Please direct any questions about the new SDK to the [[http://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine-go][Go App Engine discussion group]].
