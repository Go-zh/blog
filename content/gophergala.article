You can read about the rules of the hackathon

of what to expect.

During this event gophers from all around the globe will form teams to build
great applications using Go as the main tool. Afterwards, all the participants
will vote for their favorite applications and the 20 highest voted applications
will be ranked by a jury of renowned names from the community, including some
members of the Go core team. More information on the judging phase can be found
[[http://gophergala.com/judging/][here]].

And in case you needed one more reason to

"What prizes?" you ask. Well, that’s a

sure you won’t be disappointed.
