* Introduction

We are excited to announce [[http://go-tour.appspot.com/][A Tour of Go]], a guided tour of the Go programming language you can run from your browser.

The tour is hands-on, demonstrating the language through code samples that you can modify, compile, and run from the tour itself. (The technology behind the [[https://golang.org/doc/play/][Go Playground]] does the work.)

The tour has three sections. The first section covers basic syntax and data structures; the second discusses methods and interfaces; and the third introduces Go's concurrency primitives. Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've learned.

So, what are you waiting for? [[http://go-tour.appspot.com/][Get started now!]]
