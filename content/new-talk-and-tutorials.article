New Talk and Tutorials

* Introduction

Rob Pike recently gave a talk at Stanford's [[http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/][Computer Systems Colloquium]] (EE380). Titled [[http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/100428.html][_Another_Go_at_Language_Design_]], the presentation gives an overview of the itches Go was built to scratch, and how Go addresses those problems. You can view [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VcArS4Wpqk][a video stream of the talk]], and [[http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/100428-pike-stanford.pdf][download the slides]].

Last week's release included a code lab, [[https://golang.org/doc/codelab/wiki/][Writing Web Applications]], that details the construction of a simple wiki program. It is a practical introduction to some fundamental Go concepts, and the first of a series of Go code labs.

Lastly, we are often asked "How do Go packages work?" It's easier to show than to explain, so I put together a [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDWBJOXs_iI][Go Packages screen cast]] that demonstrates the process of writing, building, installing, and redistributing Go packages. I hope to post more of these covering a variety of Go programming topics to the [[http://youtube.com/gocoding][gocoding YouTube channel]] in the near future.
